## Current status (as of 2025-11-30)

- Project scaffold: Vite + React + Tailwind CSS
- Homepage with feature list and `ChatMockup` component (mock chat UI)
- `ChatMockup` accepts messages locally and shows them inline; explicit "Open full chat" navigates to `/chat` with the last message passed as navigation state
- Routing implemented with `react-router-dom` (`/` and `/chat` routes)
- `ChatPage`, `ProfileMenu`, and `FeedbackModal` components exist
- Lottie animation placeholder and Framer Motion animations are used on the homepage
- `ContactSection` component exists but was removed from the homepage (kept in repo for reuse)

## Quick start (Windows PowerShell)

From the project root (no absolute paths):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the development server (usually http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## Notes

- This repository includes a `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` to prepare the project for GitHub.
- If you want the `ContactSection` removed entirely from the repository, tell me and I will delete that file.
- I can replace the footer social placeholders with SVG icons (LinkedIn/GitHub/Twitter) if desired.

## Next suggestions

- Add a `LICENSE` (e.g., MIT) and a `CONTRIBUTING.md` for collaborators.
- Add production build and deployment instructions if you plan to publish the project.
- Wire up a backend or API for real chat responses.

If you want any of those done now, tell me which one and I'll add it.
